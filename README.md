All files contained within this folder are for anyone to use and take information from. Note that they are programs that I have made for my own use and don't come with user guidance so use at your own "risk". They may be of use, they may not.

Also to note is that these codes are written as part of a post 3rd year mini project in collaboration with RAL Space under the supervision of Dr Jason P Byrne.
